# LearningStroustrup
Learning materials for the Stroustrup book on c++

## HowTo
- Use CLI - Command Line Interface
- To compile: ```g++ -o prog1 prog1.cc``` or replace the prog1 to compile something else.
- Compilation - the process of transformation of the original syntax (c++ syntax) into the machine instructions. It's a very complicated process, however, for you, all you need to know is that it directly maps your c++ instructions into the machine instructions

## Task1:
- Chapters 2-3
- Chapter 3 has the Calculator program implementation - code it up!
